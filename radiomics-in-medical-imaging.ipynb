      "\n",
      "✅ **Data Leakage Prevention**: Train/test split before ANY preprocessing\n",
      "✅ **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Grid search with nested cross-validation\n",
      "✅ **Statistical Validation**: Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests\n",
      "✅ **Confidence Intervals**: Bootstrap analysis with 1000 iterations\n",
      "✅ **Feature Stability**: Analysis across multiple random splits\n",
      "✅ **Comprehensive Reporting**: JSON + text reports + visualizations\n",
      "✅ **SHAP Analysis**: Model interpretability analysis\n",
      "✅ **Publication Ready**: All methodological best practices implemented\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Features:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **No Data Leakage**: All preprocessing fitted only on training data\n",
      "- **Robust Validation**: 5-fold CV + bootstrap confidence intervals\n",
      "- **Feature Stability**: Identifies consistently important features\n",
      "- **Statistical Testing**: Tests significance between models\n",
      "- **Comprehensive Metrics**: AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1\n",
      "- **Interpretability**: SHAP values and feature importance analysis\n",
      "- **Reproducible**: Fixed random seeds throughout\n",
      "- **Scalable**: Configurable patient counts and parameters\n",
      "\n",
      "## Expected Runtime:\n",
      "- Quick Test (10 patients/class): ~5-10 minutes\n",
      "- Full Pipeline (65 patients/class): ~30-60 minutes\n",
